# CHANGELOG

> **Research scope:** Entries in this changelog describe features evaluated in authorized labs and defensive benchmarking programs. Follow the [Legal Disclaimer](DISCLAIMER.md) and [Responsible Use Guidelines](RESPONSIBLE_USE.md). We work with security vendors to investigate any misuse—report concerns to [botbrowser@bk.ru](mailto:botbrowser@bk.ru).


## [2025-11-17] 

### Major
**Chromium Core → 142.0.7444.163**  
Engine updated to Chrome’s current stable. You get up‑to‑date security work and web‑platform behavior, and version‑based heuristics have less room to flag mismatches.

### New
**Brand full‑version override**  
`--bot-config-brand-full-version` sets the brand’s full version independently of the UA full version. Helpful where a vendor’s cadence diverges from Chromium and sites cross‑check UA‑CH with brand metadata.

Example (Edge spoofing):
```bash
--bot-config-browser-brand=edge \
--bot-config-ua-full-version=142.0.7444.135 \
--bot-config-brand-full-version=142.0.3595.65
```

**Opera brand**  
`--bot-config-browser-brand=opera` is supported. UA, Client Hints and brand cues are shaped to look like real Opera.

### Improvements
**Canvas2D noise**  
Noise insertion is steadier frame‑to‑frame and less tied to individual draw operations. Probes see a calmer fingerprint surface while the image stays the same.

**Android DevTools ergonomics**  
Under Android emulation, the inspector no longer inherits page zoom or CSS font scaling. Tool panes and monospace fonts stay consistent regardless of emulated viewport.

### Fixes
**Touch emulation**  
In touch mode, `Input.dispatchMouseEvent` could miss. The pointer/touch bridge is corrected; synthesized taps and clicks land reliably, including inside iframe trees.

**Brave parity**  
When brand=Brave, the UA full version and selected Client Hints are now hidden the same way real Brave does it.

**Edge on Android UA**  
User‑Agent construction for Edge on Android now carries accurate brand/version tokens and platform identifiers.

## [2025-11-10] 

### Major
- **Chromium 142.0.7444.135 parity** — Synced core to the latest Chrome 142 stable build for up‑to‑date security patches, modern Web APIs, and version parity that reduces “version skew” signals used by anti‑bot systems.

### New
- **Locked user data directory protection** — On startup, if the provided `--user-data-dir` is already held by a running Chromium/BotBrowser process, BotBrowser now **shows a clear message and exits** instead of silently attaching to the old process. This prevents cross‑session contamination (cookies, storage, profile state) and hard‑to‑trace side‑effects.
- **OS‑specific AudioContext defaults** — Normalized **AudioContext** defaults per OS (e.g., base characteristics like sample rate/latency and related init parameters) so audio capability fingerprints line up with the target platform. This removes subtle OS drift that some risk engines use for anomaly scoring.

### Improvements
- **Emoji & font fallback stability across platforms** — Refined the font fallback chain and glyph selection so **emoji and CJK glyphs** render consistently on Windows/macOS/Linux. This reduces cross‑platform text‑metrics variance and avoids mixed‑glyph fallbacks that can change hashes or layout in edge cases.
- **Touch events in OOPIF** — Improved routing of emulated touch gestures for **Out‑Of‑Process IFrames (OOPIF)**, ensuring CDP commands like `Input.synthesizeTapGesture` work reliably inside OOPIF trees. Mobile flows embedded in cross‑origin iframes now respond as expected.

### Fixes
- **Ubuntu Bluetooth spoof leakage** — Fixed a Linux/Ubuntu‑specific issue where forged Bluetooth properties could leak inconsistent state. Spoofed Bluetooth exposure is now unified so websites can’t infer environment details from mismatched availability/signaling.
- **Media types (expand) default** — Resolved an issue where `--bot-config-media-types=expand` (and the default behavior) could be ignored in some scenarios. With this fix, local decoders are correctly surfaced so users can **select resolutions** on major video sites.
- **WebRTC SDP negotiation** — Corrected edge cases where SDP **audio codec selection or direction attributes** failed to negotiate. More robust media negotiation prevents call/setup loops and reduces fingerprinting surface from abnormal SDP.

---


## [2025-11-02] 

### Major
- **Chromium Core Upgrade → 142.0.7444.60**  
  Synced with the latest Chrome 142 stable to keep rendering, networking, storage, and media behavior aligned with upstream, reduce version‑based heuristics, and inherit current security/perf updates.

### New
- **`--bot-config-disable-console-message` (default: true)**  
  Disables console message output to avoid CDP log noise leaking into the page context or logs in production environments. Tracks: issue **#75**.
- **`--bot-config-fonts=expand` mode**  
  When a profile lacks specific fonts, `expand` will load additional system fonts to increase match rate and authenticity.

### Improvements
- **Scrollbar width fidelity across OSs**  
  More accurate per‑OS scrollbar metrics so `window.innerWidth` and `document.documentElement.clientWidth` remain consistent and layout shifts are avoided.
- **Cross‑platform font loading & caching**  
  Extracted common font sets across platforms, optimized render/cache logic, and **bundled Noto Sans** for broader coverage; improves paint time and UX while keeping fingerprint parity.
- **Auto‑language by IP**  
  Smarter locale selection based on proxy IP and region signals to choose a more appropriate UI language by default.
- **Android simulation without xdg‑open popups**  
  Suppresses spurious `xdg-open` invocations during Android emulation to prevent erroneous system dialogs.
- **CPU architecture realism (ARM vs x86)**  
  Tightened architecture‑specific surfaces (timings/caps) for higher authenticity when switching between ARM and x86 profiles.

### Fixes
- **Locale leakage via `Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().locale`**  
  Prevented host locale from surfacing unintentionally through `Intl` so locale now reflects the emulated/profiled environment.
- **WebGL stability under performance jitter**  
  Resolved a case where jitter modeling could destabilize WebGL metrics; GPU paths now remain stable with jitter enabled.
- **CJK font visibility**  
  Fixed scenarios where **Korean / Japanese / Chinese** glyphs could fail to render due to coverage/fallback mismatches.
- **Crash with `--bot-config-color-scheme`**  
  Corrected a crash that could occur when forcing color scheme overrides.
- **Headless window sizing with iframes**  
  Fixed an iframe handling bug that could mis‑apply window size in headless runs.

---


## [2025-10-23] 

### Major
- **Chromium Core Upgrade → 142 (Early Stable)**  
  BotBrowser is now aligned with **Chromium 142** (Chrome Early Stable). This keeps Web Platform/DevTools semantics and browser surfaces consistent with upstream Chrome, reduces version‑based heuristics some detectors rely on, and includes the latest security and performance updates.

---

## [2025-10-20] 

### Major
- **Chromium Core Upgrade → 141.0.7390.108**  
  Synced to Chrome 141.0.7390.108 to stay aligned with the current stable engine for security patches, performance updates, and API parity. This reduces version‑based heuristics and keeps rendering/network/media behavior consistent with upstream Chrome.

### Improvements
- **Geo‑IP caching**  
  The resolved proxy public IP and derived geolocation are now cached and reused across page opens, cutting repeated lookups and speeding up initial navigation.

### Fixes
- **Window Controls Overlay attribute order**  
  Dynamic toggling of WindowControlsOverlay could reorder certain DOM attributes. The update stabilizes attribute order during toggles so the DOM signature remains consistent.

- **General stability**  
  Hardened several lifecycle and teardown paths that under specific edge conditions could lead to a crash.

- **Android Date/Time Picker**  
  Opening the native date/time picker while using Android profiles could crash in some environments. The initialization path has been corrected so the picker works reliably.

- **`--proxy-ip` with auto language/locale**  
  When a proxy IP was provided via `--proxy-ip`, automatic language and locale did not always align with the supplied region. Mapping now follows the provided proxy IP so UI language updates correctly.

- **Performance jitter alignment**  
  Modeling jitter could desynchronize timing between the main thread and Workers/SharedWorkers. Jitter seed and variance are now coordinated so threads remain time‑aligned while keeping natural variability.

- **Android emoji rendering**  
  Some Android profiles showed missing or incorrect emoji due to fallback mismatches. The emoji font availability and fallback chain have been corrected so shaping matches real Android.

- **Extensions + `--bot-config-always-active=true`**  
  Fixed a crash that could occur when loading extensions while the **always‑active** mode was enabled. Extensions now load reliably with the window kept active.

---

## [2025-10-12] 

### Major
- **Chromium Core Upgrade → 141.0.7390.77**
  - **What**: Sync to the latest stable Chrome 141 release.
  - **Why**: Keeps Rendering/Network/Storage/Media in parity with upstream, reduces version‑based heuristics, and includes current security fixes.
  - **Impact**: More deterministic behavior on sites that gate features by major version; lower drift on fingerprint surfaces impacted by minor engine changes.

- **Experimental: BotCanvasLab (Canvas2D recorder)**
  - **What**: An opt‑in tool that **records Canvas2D draw operations** and exports **replayable code snippets** (trace → code).
  - **Use cases**: Reverse‑inspect how a site draws charts/captchas/signature pads; reproduce rendering flows; compare visual diffs across hosts/profiles.
  - **Enable**:
    ```bash
    chrome.exe --no-sandbox --bot-canvas-record-file=/abs/path/trace.canvas.jsonl --bot-profile="C:\\absolute\\path\\to\\profile.enc"
    ```
  - **Notes**: Recording is **local** and grows with draw calls; recommended for analysis/debug, not for high‑volume production.
  - **Docs**: https://github.com/botswin/BotBrowser/tree/main/tools/botcanvas

### New
- **CLI: `--bot-config-webrtc-ice` (custom ICE servers)**
  - **What**: Choose STUN/TURN presets or provide a custom list to **avoid TURN‑level IP disclosure**.
  - **Examples**:
    - Google preset:
      ```bash
      --bot-config-webrtc-ice=google
      ```
    - Custom list (comma‑separated):
      ```bash
      --bot-config-webrtc-ice=custom:stun:stun.l.google.com:19302,turn:turn.example.com
      ```
  - **Why**: Some probes (e.g., https://ipbinding.online/) try to infer the real network by observing TURN traffic; controlling ICE servers reduces unintended leakage.

- **CLI: `--bot-config-always-active` (true/false, default: true)**
  - **What**: Keep windows **active** even when unfocused.
  - **Behavior**: Suppresses `blur/visibilitychange`; forces `document.hidden=false`; caret keeps blinking; applies **per‑window** (multi‑window friendly).
  - **Why**: Certain sites degrade features or throttle actions when the tab isn’t considered active.

### Improved
- **Runtime features control (finer per‑OS toggling)**
  - More precise reading/toggling of runtime flags at startup, including OS‑conditioned switches → **more stable cross‑OS fingerprints** when moving profiles between Windows/macOS/Android.

- **Chrome component plugin preload (ID: `ghbmnnjooekpmoecnnnilnnbdlolhkhi`)**
  - Hardened preload path and timing so this stock component extension reliably appears; improves **Chrome‑authentic** signals that some scanners expect.

- **WebGL/WebGL2 parameter reads**
  - Reworked parameter access to avoid **application‑settable states** and cross‑driver quirks; prevents false values and closes detection patterns reported by https://fv.pro/

- **Media types default → `expand`**
  - `--bot-config-media-types` now defaults to **`expand`** (previously `profile`) so BotBrowser leverages **local decoders** by default → more accurate `canPlayType`/MSE decisions.
  - To keep old behavior, pass `--bot-config-media-types=profile`.

- **AudioContext noise tuning**
  - Adjusted distribution/phase to better defend against **audio fingerprinting** with minimal audible/timing side‑effects.

### Fixed
- **Font sizes stable under `--bot-config-noise-text-rects`**
  - Fixed an interaction where text‑rect noise perturbed computed font‑size metrics; sizes now remain stable.

- **Geolocation reliability**
  - Fixed geolocation not working in some configurations. Tracks: https://github.com/botswin/BotBrowser/issues/69

- **Android window sizing**
  - Corrected window metrics when emulating Android so viewport matches profile expectations.

- **Proxy robustness & validation**
  - Avoid crashes on failing proxies; emit clear error messages for malformed proxy arguments to prevent misconfig loops.

  Adds platform‑specific DRM capability emulation to satisfy advanced probes on certain sites/platforms.

- **RLZ Re‑enabled**  
  Restores RLZ behavior to improve compatibility with Google services that expect it.

### Improved
- **Android Speech Voices**  
  More realistic `speechSynthesis.getVoices()` on Android profiles (language coverage, ordering, default selection) to better match real devices.

- **Cross‑platform Feature Parity (outside `runtime_enabled_features.json5`)**  
  Adapts a set of runtime capabilities not listed in the upstream JSON to keep platform‑agnostic fingerprints consistent across OS targets.

- **X‑Browser Identification (Google)**  
  Rewritten per Google‑recommended approach to increase Chrome authenticity signals.

- **Stability with Browser Brand Overrides**  
  Hardened brand‑switching paths to prevent occasional crashes under specific brand settings.

### Fixed
- **Screen Metrics from Profile**  
  `config.screen.width` / `config.screen.height` now consistently apply on startup and new windows.

- **Auto Language from Timezone**  
  Fixed a case where timezone‑driven locale auto‑detection could fail to update the UI language.

---

## [2025-09-27]

### Major
- **Chromium Core Upgrade → 141**  
  Stay in lock‑step with the latest Chrome for modern API parity, performance, and security fixes.

### Compatibility / New
- **MediaCapabilities `decodingInfo` (DRM probing) hardening**  
  Aligns responses with real‑Chrome behavior when sites probe **DRM capability** via `MediaCapabilities.decodingInfo` (e.g., H.264/H.265 + Widevine flow). Prevents capability mismatches and reduces a class of DRM‑support fingerprint checks.

### Fixed
- **Chrome component plugin preload**  
  Resolved an intermittent race where the default Chrome component plugin (**ID: ghbmnnjooekpmoecnnnilnnbdlolhkhi**) might fail to load. Ensures consistent presence across sessions for scanners that expect it.

- **Android profile stability**  
  Fixed a crash that could occur when initializing **Android fingerprints** under certain setups (ordering/initialization edge cases). Improves reliability for mobile emulation.

---


## [2025-09-22]


### Improved
- **Audio fingerprinting on x86 (no-noise hardware modeling)**
  Refined DSP/stack paths so x86 architectures can produce **native‑like audio fingerprints without injecting noise**, improving pass rates on vendors that score audio stability.

- **Chrome brand fidelity & de‑Chromiumization**
  Audited and tuned brand/feature switches to better emulate **Chrome** and suppress Chromium‑specific traits, improving compatibility across brand detection systems.

### Privacy
- **First‑run telemetry suppression**
  Removed non‑essential Google statistics/metrics requests on initial launch to reduce network exhaust and improve privacy (and a small bandwidth win).

### Authenticity
- **Bundled Chrome component plugin**
  Preloads the stock Chrome component extension (**ID: ghbmnnjooekpmoecnnnilnnbdlolhkhi**) to mirror real‑Chrome environments. Improves compatibility with fingerprinting tools like **fingerprint‑scan.com** that expect this presence.

### Fixed
- **Locale ↔ Speech voice alignment**
  When language auto‑detection adjusts the UI/locale, the **default speechSynthesis voice language** is now updated accordingly. Resolves mismatch flags observed by some probes (e.g., creepjs timezone/voice consistency checks).


---



## [2025-09-15]

### Major
- **Chromium Core Upgrade → 140.0.7339.128**
  Keeps BotBrowser in lock‑step with the latest stable Chrome for improved performance, security patches, and parity across modern web/APIs.

- **Proxy Subsystem Rewrite (faster • more stable • unified config)**
  Re‑architected proxy stack to reduce connection latency and flakiness. **Deprecated** `--proxy-username` / `--proxy-password`; now use a single **`--proxy-server`** (or profile) endpoint that supports **auth & multiple protocols** (e.g., `http(s)`, `socks5`). Example: `socks5://user:pass@host:port`.

- **Per‑Context Proxy (createBrowserContext)**
  You can assign a **different `proxy-server` per BrowserContext**, including authenticated endpoints. Enables multi‑proxy, high‑concurrency tasks in one process.
  Resolves: https://github.com/botswin/BotBrowser/issues/61

### Improved / Fixed
- **DNS Leak Hardening for SOCKS5**
  Fixed a case where domain resolution might occur locally under SOCKS5, preventing DNS leaks and strengthening stealth.

### New
- **CLI: `--proxy-ip` (profile key: `configs.proxy.ip`)**
  Provide the proxy’s public IP via CLI or profile so BotBrowser **skips per‑page IP lookups**, speeding up page open. Combine with `--bot-config-timezone` to emulate regions/timezones consistently.

- **CLI: `--bot-config-mobile-force-touch` (profile key: `configs.mobileForceTouch`)**
  Force **on/off** touch emission when simulating mobile devices. Useful for sites that require touch events regardless of the detected environment.
  Resolves: https://github.com/botswin/BotBrowser/issues/65

### Migration Notes
- Replace `--proxy-username/--proxy-password` with **embedded credentials in `--proxy-server`** (or in the profile).
  Example: `http://user:pass@ip:port`, `socks5://user:pass@ip:port`.


---

## [2025-09-06]

### Major
- **Chromium Core Upgrade → 140**
  Upgraded engine to Chromium **140** to maintain Chrome‑level parity and stealth consistency across APIs and anti‑bot surfaces.

### Improved
- **Slimmer Profiles (≈1.3 MB → ≈100 KB)**
  Refactored profile packaging **without reducing fingerprint coverage**. Results: faster startup, lower I/O, and lighter memory—better for high‑QPS orchestration and containerized runs.

### Fixed
- **WebGL2 `DRAW_BUFFER*`**
  Corrected an override that could set **`DRAW_BUFFER*`** state incorrectly during WebGL2 context creation—an issue certain sites probed for detection. Now adheres to spec/real‑device values, restoring pass rates.

---


## [2025-09-02]

### Major Feature
- **Framework‑less Automation — `--bot-script`**
  - Execute a JavaScript file **right after BotBrowser starts** in a privileged, non‑extension context where **`chrome.debugger`** is available.
  - Build automation **without Playwright/Puppeteer** while still driving CDP via `chrome.debugger` — reducing framework/CDP leak surface and giving **pre‑navigation control**.
  - **Docs:** Chrome `chrome.debugger` — <https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/debugger/>
  - **Usage:** `botbrowser --no-sandbox --bot-profile=/absolute/path/to/profile.enc --bot-script=/path/boot.js`
  - **Examples:** [Bot Script Automation](examples/bot-script) (includes Cloudflare Turnstile automation)

### Improved
- **Embedded System Fonts (Cross‑OS)**
  - Bundled **more accurate system fonts** into resources so BotBrowser can emulate Windows/macOS/Linux text rendering with higher fidelity (wider glyph coverage, more consistent shaping/kerning).

- **Font Fallback Robustness (incl. Emoji)**
  - Tuned fallback chains so missing glyphs (emoji, CJK, rare symbols) resolve to the **same fonts a real device would use**.
  - Stabilizes **TextMetrics/Canvas** values and line‑breaking; strengthens resistance to **emoji/font‑based checks (e.g., hCaptcha)**.
  - **Workers parity:** Worker/SharedWorker/ServiceWorker now mirror the main thread’s fallback behavior to avoid cross‑thread hash mismatches.

---

## [2025-08-29]

  *Prevents easy capability-based bot detection.*

- **Faster Proxy IP Detection (Endpoint Race)**
  Parallel fetch to:
  `https://api64.ipify.org`, `https://ifconfig.me/ip`, `https://ident.me`, `https://icanhazip.com`, `https://checkip.amazonaws.com`, `https://ipecho.net/plain`.
  *Returns the first successful response to speed up network initialization.*

### Changed
- **Caches Off by Default**
  Disabled **GPU program cache** and **disk cache** by default.
  *Reduces persistent artifacts and cross-session correlation risk.*

### Improved
- **Ubuntu Cross-Worker Font Consistency**
  Workers (`Worker`/`SharedWorker`/`ServiceWorker`) now mirror the main thread's font defaults so emoji and special glyphs match.
  *Fixes CreepJS workers test (consistent canvas hashes across threads).*
  Test: https://abrahamjuliot.github.io/creepjs/tests/workers.html

### Fixed
- **Profile-Induced Crash (Access Violation)**
  Resolved rare crashes caused by specific profiles.
  *Improves stability when loading edge-case profiles.*

- **Cross‑platform fidelity**
Refined per‑OS rendering differences (fonts, CSS, anti‑aliasing, text sizing) so profiles behave consistently across Windows/macOS/Android.
- **Locale auto‑adapt**
`locale: "auto"` now lets BotBrowser derive `locale` from proxy IP and language settings for realistic regional behavior.

---

## [2025-08-17]

### Added
- **`configs.disableDebugger` (default: `true`)**
  Prevents JavaScript `debugger` statements from pausing execution, keeping flows non-interactive during automation.

- **New Start Page (New Tab)**
  Replaced new-tab page to display live environment data: Proxy IP, Timezone, Latitude/Longitude, User-Agent, WebGL, etc., giving instant visibility into the BotBrowser context.

- **`configs.keyboard`**
  Choose keyboard fingerprint source: `profile` (emulated from profile) or `real` (use system keyboard).

### Optimized
- **Binary Size Reduction (Windows/macOS)**
  Removed unnecessary font assets; reduced binary size from ~**600 MB** to **< 300 MB**. Faster downloads and smaller disk footprint.

### Improved
- **TextMetrics Noise Stabilization**
  Switched from per-string noise to a unified, stable noise model and preserved floating‑point precision after noise injection—better resilience against **hCaptcha** text-metrics checks.

- **Dynamic Blink Feature Loading**
  Parses and applies Blink features at runtime based on the emulated environment (**Windows / macOS / Android**), improving realism and compatibility.

- **`--bot-title` UI Enhancement**
  Beyond window/icon labels, the custom title now also appears as a label to the right of the toolbar **Refresh** button, improving multi-window recognition.


---

## [2025-08-12]

### Added
- **Built-in H.264/H.265 (AVC/HEVC) Decoders**
  Enabled AVC/H.264 and HEVC/H.265 decoding out of the box (no external OS codecs required). Improves HTML5 video, MSE/EME playback compatibility, reduces codec-missing fallbacks, and keeps media behavior aligned with stock Chrome.

### Fixed
- **RFC 6381–Compliant MIME Codec Parsing**
  Reworked `mimeTypes` codec-string parser to follow RFC 6381 (e.g., `avc1.42E01E`, `mp4a.40.2`, `hvc1.1.6.L93.B0`), including case/spacing tolerance and multi-codec lists. Prevents inaccurate results in `canPlayType` and MSE SourceBuffer checks that could trigger antifraud heuristics.

---

## [2025-08-07]

### Major Update
- **Upgraded to Chromium 139**
  Synced BotBrowser to **Chromium 139**, bringing the newest web platform features, performance improvements, and security patches.

- **Browser Brand Config**: New `configs.browserBrand` option for `chromium`, `chrome`, `brave`, or `edge`, enabling high-fidelity brand emulation.
- **Brave Simulation**: Full Brave browser emulation including `userAgent`, `userAgentData`, and `navigator.brave.isBrave` properties.
- **Edge Simulation**: Full Microsoft Edge emulation covering `userAgent`, `userAgentData`, and Edge-specific APIs.
- **WebKit Emulation**: Preliminary WebKit engine simulation for basic Safari-like behaviors.
- **Random History Injection**: `configs.injectRandomHistory` injects realistic history entries (URLs, timestamps) on new page loads without an opener.

### Improved
- **CPU Core Count Simulation**: More precise spoofing of logical CPU cores based on profile to evade advanced detection.
- **WebGPU Limits Simulation**: Emulates `maxStorageBuffersInFragmentStage`, `maxStorageTexturesInFragmentStage`, `maxStorageBuffersInVertexStage`, and `maxStorageTexturesInVertexStage` parameters.
- **Android Window Defaults**: Android device simulation now defaults to `"window": "profile"`, using profile-defined screen and window dimensions for pixel-perfect accuracy.
- **Debugger Statement Blocking**: Blocks `debugger` statements by default to prevent DevTools detection by antibot scripts.

### Fixed
- **Android DevTools Window Mode**: Ensures DevTools open in a separate window (not docked) during Android simulation to avoid UI rendering issues.
- **Auto Language/Locale Sync**: Fixed issue where `configs.languages = "auto"` sometimes failed to update the browser’s locale automatically.
- **Iframe WebRTC IP Leak**: Fixed a WebRTC local IP leak when running inside iframes.
