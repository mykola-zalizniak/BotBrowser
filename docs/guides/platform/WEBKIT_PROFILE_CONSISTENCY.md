# WebKit-Family Profile Consistency

> Use WebKit-family `.enc` profiles when a workflow needs that browser-family identity on BotBrowser.

## Overview

WebKit-family Profile Consistency is profile-backed. The encrypted profile carries the browser-family data, and the browser loads it before the page starts.

At a high level, the profile coordinates selected WebKit-family browser API surfaces, TLS ClientHello behavior, and HTTP/2 behavior so the selected browser-family identity remains consistent across supported hosts.

Use this profile line for desktop and mobile WebKit-family bundles. Use Chromium-family profiles for Chrome, Chromium, Edge, Brave, Opera, Android, and Android WebView.

For the product page, see [WebKit-family Profile Consistency](../../../WEBKIT_PROFILE_CONSISTENCY.md).

## Requirements

- BotBrowser 149.0.7827.59 or newer.
- ENT Tier4 access.
- A WebKit-family `.enc` profile issued through the enterprise channel.
- A separate `--user-data-dir` for each browser instance.

## Launch

Use the profile the same way as other encrypted BotBrowser profiles:

```bash
chromium-browser \
  --bot-profile="/absolute/path/to/webkit-family-profile.enc" \
  --user-data-dir="$(mktemp -d)"
```

For Per-Context Fingerprint, pass the profile when the BrowserContext is created. The profile should be present before the first page in that context starts. See [Per-Context Fingerprint](../../../PER_CONTEXT_FINGERPRINT.md) for the CDP flow.

## Notes

- Do not use `browserBrand` or User-Agent overrides to build this profile line by hand.
- Keep proxy settings with the browser instance or BrowserContext that uses the profile.
- Validate desktop and mobile profile bundles separately.
- Keep raw validation captures and profile internals out of public documents.
