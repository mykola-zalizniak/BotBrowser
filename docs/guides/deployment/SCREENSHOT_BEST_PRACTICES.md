# Screenshot Best Practices

> Capture stable, reproducible browser screenshots across headless and headful environments.

## Prerequisites

- **BotBrowser** installed and running. See [Installation Guide](../../../INSTALLATION.md).
- **A profile file** (`.enc` for production).
- **Playwright or Puppeteer** installed for programmatic screenshots.
- **On Linux:** A virtual display (Xvfb) must be running. See [Headless Server Setup](HEADLESS_SERVER_SETUP.md).

## Quick Start

### Playwright

```javascript
import { chromium } from "playwright-core";

const browser = await chromium.launch({
    executablePath: process.env.BOTBROWSER_EXEC_PATH,
    headless: true,
    args: [
        `--bot-profile=${process.env.BOT_PROFILE_PATH}`,
    ],
});

const page = await browser.newPage();
await page.goto("https://example.com");

// Viewport screenshot
await page.screenshot({ path: "viewport.png" });

// Full page screenshot
await page.screenshot({ path: "fullpage.png", fullPage: true });

await browser.close();
```

### Puppeteer

```javascript
import puppeteer from "puppeteer-core";

const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
    executablePath: process.env.BOTBROWSER_EXEC_PATH,
    headless: true,
    defaultViewport: null,
    args: [
        `--bot-profile=${process.env.BOT_PROFILE_PATH}`,
    ],
});

const page = await browser.newPage();
await page.goto("https://example.com");

// Viewport screenshot
await page.screenshot({ path: "viewport.png" });

// Full page screenshot
await page.screenshot({ path: "fullpage.png", fullPage: true });

await browser.close();
```

## How It Works

Screenshots in BotBrowser use the same rendering pipeline as a regular Chrome installation, with fingerprint properties applied from the profile:

1. **Resolution and DPI.** The profile defines screen dimensions and device pixel ratio (DPR). A profile with DPR 2 produces screenshots at 2x the viewport pixel dimensions. In Puppeteer, always set `defaultViewport: null` so Puppeteer does not override the profile's display settings. In Playwright, do not set explicit viewport dimensions in context options.

2. **Viewport vs. full page.** A viewport screenshot captures only the visible area. A full page screenshot scrolls the entire page and stitches the result. The viewport dimensions come from the profile.

3. **Rendering consistency.** Canvas noise, font rendering, and WebGL output are all determined by the profile. Screenshots taken with the same profile produce identical visual output across different host systems.

4. **Headless Linux.** On servers without a monitor, Xvfb provides the virtual display that Chrome's compositor needs. Without it, screenshots time out or produce blank images.

## Common Scenarios

### Correct screenshot order

When taking both viewport and full page screenshots, capture the full page screenshot first or wait between captures. Taking a viewport screenshot immediately followed by a full page screenshot in rapid succession can cause rendering issues:

```javascript
// Recommended: wait for the page to stabilize
await page.goto("https://example.com", { waitUntil: "networkidle" });

// Take viewport screenshot
await page.screenshot({ path: "viewport.png" });

// Wait briefly before full page capture
await page.waitForTimeout(500);
await page.screenshot({ path: "fullpage.png", fullPage: true });
```

### PNG vs. JPEG format

```javascript
// PNG: lossless, larger files, better for text-heavy pages
await page.screenshot({ path: "output.png", type: "png" });

// JPEG: lossy, smaller files, configurable quality
await page.screenshot({ path: "output.jpg", type: "jpeg", quality: 80 });
```

Use PNG when pixel accuracy matters (fingerprint verification, visual regression testing). Use JPEG for general-purpose captures where file size is a concern.

### High-DPI screenshots

The screenshot resolution is determined by the profile's device pixel ratio. A profile with `devicePixelRatio: 2` on a 1920x1080 viewport produces a 3840x2160 screenshot:

```javascript
// The profile controls DPI. No additional configuration needed.
await page.screenshot({ path: "hidpi.png" });
```

To override the profile's DPI for a specific use case:

```bash
chromium-browser \
    --bot-profile="/path/to/profile.enc" \
    --bot-config-disable-device-scale-factor=true
```

### Screenshots on headless Linux

Ensure Xvfb is running with a resolution at least as large as the profile's screen dimensions:

```bash
# Start Xvfb with sufficient resolution
Xvfb :10 -screen 0 2560x1440x24 -ac &
export DISPLAY=:10.0

# Launch BotBrowser
chromium-browser \
    --headless \
    --no-sandbox \
    --bot-profile="/path/to/profile.enc" \
    --remote-debugging-port=9222
```

If the Xvfb resolution is smaller than the profile's screen size, screenshots may be clipped or produce unexpected results.

### Element-specific screenshots

```javascript
// Playwright
const element = await page.locator("#target-element");
await element.screenshot({ path: "element.png" });

// Puppeteer
const element = await page.$("#target-element");
await element.screenshot({ path: "element.png" });
```

<a id="troubleshooting"></a>

## Troubleshooting / FAQ

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Screenshot times out on Linux | Ensure Xvfb is running and `DISPLAY=:10.0` is set. See [Headless Server Setup](HEADLESS_SERVER_SETUP.md). |
| Blank or all-white screenshot | The page may not have finished loading. Use `waitUntil: "networkidle"` or wait for a specific element. |
| Screenshot resolution is wrong | In Puppeteer, set `defaultViewport: null` to let the profile control dimensions. In Playwright, do not set explicit viewport options. |
| Full page screenshot crashes | Avoid capturing viewport and full page screenshots in rapid succession. Add a brief wait between them. |
| Fonts look different than expected | BotBrowser uses the profile's embedded font bundle. Verify the profile matches your expected platform (Windows, macOS, etc.). |
| Colors appear different across runs | This is expected. Canvas noise produces deterministic but session-unique visual output. Use the same profile and noise seed for identical results. |
