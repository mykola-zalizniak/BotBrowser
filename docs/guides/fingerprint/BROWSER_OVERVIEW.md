## Prerequisites

No technical prerequisites. This guide provides an overview of fingerprint-based tracking and how BotBrowser addresses it.

## Quick Start

```bash
chromium-browser \
  --bot-profile="/path/to/profile.enc"
```

Start with this launch to establish a clean baseline before adding extra overrides.

## Overview

Browser fingerprinting is a tracking technique that identifies users by collecting attributes from their browser and device. Unlike cookies, which store explicit identifiers that users can clear, fingerprinting assembles a composite identifier from dozens of properties that the browser exposes during normal operation. Users have no visibility into when this collection occurs and no standard mechanism to reset or opt out.

This guide covers what BotBrowser protects, why the technique is classified as a privacy violation by standards bodies and regulators, and how BotBrowser's approach works.

## Why Fingerprinting Is a Privacy Violation

Major standards bodies, browser vendors, and regulatory authorities have classified browser fingerprinting as a privacy threat:

- **W3C** published [mitigation guidance](https://www.w3.org/TR/fingerprinting-guidance/) stating that fingerprinting "allows for tracking of activity without clear or effective user controls."
- **Apple WebKit** classifies fingerprinting as [covert tracking](https://webkit.org/tracking-prevention-policy/) and actively works to prevent it in Safari.
- **Mozilla** treats fingerprinting scripts as tracking and [blocks them by default](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Anti_tracking_policy) in Firefox.
- **Google Chrome** acknowledges fingerprinting as a passive tracking risk and has been [reducing fingerprint surface area](https://privacysandbox.google.com/protections/user-agent) through User-Agent Reduction and Privacy Sandbox.
- **UK ICO** called fingerprinting "[not a fair means of tracking](https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/media-centre/news-and-blogs/2024/12/our-response-to-google-s-policy-change-on-fingerprinting/)" and described Google's decision to permit it as "irresponsible."
- **EU Article 29 Working Party** ruled that fingerprinting requires the same consent as cookies under the e-Privacy Directive.
- **CNIL (France)** has fined companies for fingerprinting without consent.

## What BotBrowser Protects

BotBrowser provides protection across every major fingerprint surface. Each area is controlled through the profile system at the browser engine level.

| Surface | Description | Guide |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Canvas 2D | Rendering output from the HTML5 Canvas element | [Canvas](CANVAS.md) |
| WebGL / WebGPU | GPU information and rendered image output | [WebGL](WEBGL.md) |
| AudioContext | Web Audio API processing output | [Audio](AUDIO.md) |
| Fonts | Font availability and text measurement metrics | [Fonts](FONT.md) |
| Navigator Properties | User-Agent, platform, hardware concurrency, device memory, Client Hints | [Navigator](NAVIGATOR_PROPERTIES.md) |
| Screen and Window | Resolution, device pixel ratio, color depth, window dimensions | [Screen/Window](SCREEN_WINDOW.md) |
| Performance and Timing | Timer precision and execution characteristics | [Performance](PERFORMANCE.md) |
| CSS Features | Media queries, feature support, and system preferences | [CSS](CSS_SIGNAL_CONSISTENCY.md) |
| Speech Synthesis | Available text-to-speech voices | [Speech](SPEECH_SYNTHESIS.md) |
| WebAuthn | Authenticator capabilities and platform credential support | - |
| Storage and Memory | Storage quota and heap size values | [Storage Quota](STORAGE_QUOTA.md) |
| Console Behavior | CDP domain activation consistency | [Console Suppression](CONSOLE_SUPPRESSION.md) |

## BotBrowser's Approach

BotBrowser addresses fingerprint tracking through browser engine level protection rather than JavaScript injection:

- **Deterministic noise.** Canvas, WebGL, AudioContext, and other rendering surfaces receive controlled noise that remains consistent within a session while varying across sessions.
- **Cross-platform consistency.** A profile designed for one operating system produces identical fingerprint values on any host OS, using built-in font libraries and text shaping.
- **Complete surface coverage.** Navigator properties, screen dimensions, speech synthesis voices, WebAuthn capabilities, and other API surfaces are controlled through the profile system.
- **Privacy-first design.** All protection operates at the browser engine level, through native API paths, not JavaScript injection or page-context modifications.

For configuration details, see the [CLI Flags Reference](../../../CLI_FLAGS.md) and [Advanced Features](../../../ADVANCED_FEATURES.md).

## Common Scenarios

- Capture a baseline result using the Quick Start setup.
- Change one relevant setting at a time and compare the new output.
- Keep your final launch command documented so future checks are reproducible.

## Troubleshooting / FAQ

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| Observed value does not match the profile expectation | Verify profile path, active overrides, and any framework-injected settings. |
| Same setup behaves differently on another machine | Compare BotBrowser build, profile version, host OS target, and full launch args. |
| Test results fluctuate between runs | Keep proxy, locale/timezone, and runtime load stable during comparison tests. |
