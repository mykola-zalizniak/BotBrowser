# Speech Synthesis Protection

> The SpeechSynthesis API exposes platform identity through voice enumeration. BotBrowser controls voice lists to maintain consistent identity across sessions.

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with [Browser Fingerprinting Explained](BROWSER_OVERVIEW.md).
- BotBrowser installed with a valid profile. See [Installation](../../../INSTALLATION.md).

## Quick Start

```bash
chromium-browser \
  --bot-profile="/path/to/profile.enc"
```

Start with this launch to establish a clean baseline before adding extra overrides.

## Overview

The speech synthesis voice list varies by operating system, browser build, and installed language packs, making it a privacy-relevant surface. BotBrowser controls voice enumeration at the browser engine level to ensure consistent platform identity.

## Configuration

### Speech Voices Mode

Control voice list behavior with `--bot-config-speech-voices`:

```bash
# Use profile-defined synthetic voice list (default)
--bot-config-speech-voices=profile

# Use real system voices (no protection)
--bot-config-speech-voices=real
```

When set to `profile`, BotBrowser returns a voice list consistent with the profile's declared platform and browser brand. This ensures voice data aligns with all other identity surfaces.

## How BotBrowser Provides Protection

BotBrowser generates a complete, platform-consistent voice list at the browser engine level. The voice list matches the profile's declared platform and browser brand. All voice properties and ordering are profile-appropriate. No JavaScript interception is used, so voice loading follows the standard browser pattern.

## Common Scenarios

- Capture a baseline result using the Quick Start setup.
- Change one relevant setting at a time and compare the new output.
- Keep your final launch command documented so future checks are reproducible.

## Troubleshooting / FAQ

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Voice list shows host system voices | Verify `--bot-config-speech-voices=profile` is set. |
| Google TTS voices missing in Chrome profile | Ensure `--bot-config-browser-brand=chrome` is active. Non-Chrome brands do not include Google voices. |
| Voice list empty | Some headless configurations may not initialize speech synthesis. Check profile compatibility. |
| Voice language doesn't match profile locale | Verify `--bot-config-languages` and `--bot-config-locale` are consistent with the profile. |
