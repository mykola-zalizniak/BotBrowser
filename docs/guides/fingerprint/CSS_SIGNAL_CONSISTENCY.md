# CSS Signal Consistency

> CSS features can leak platform and hardware information. BotBrowser normalizes these signals for consistent privacy protection.

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with [Browser Fingerprinting Explained](BROWSER_OVERVIEW.md).
- BotBrowser installed with a valid profile. See [Installation](../../../INSTALLATION.md).

## Quick Start

```bash
chromium-browser \
  --bot-profile="/path/to/profile.enc"
```

Start with this launch to establish a clean baseline before adding extra overrides.

## Overview

CSS provides several mechanisms that reveal information about the user's operating system, display hardware, and browser configuration. Media queries, `@supports` rules, system colors, and CSS function behavior all contribute platform-specific signals. BotBrowser normalizes all of these at the browser engine level so that reported values match the loaded profile, regardless of the host system.

## Configuration

### Color Scheme

Control the reported color scheme:

```bash
--bot-config-color-scheme=light
--bot-config-color-scheme=dark
```

### Font System

The font configuration controls how system font keywords resolve:

```bash
# Profile fonts (system-ui maps to profile's platform font)
--bot-config-fonts=profile

# Real system fonts (no protection)
--bot-config-fonts=real
```

### Display Properties

Screen and display characteristics are controlled through profile configuration:

```bash
# Use profile-defined screen properties (color depth, dimensions)
--bot-config-screen=profile
```

## How BotBrowser Normalizes These Signals

BotBrowser normalizes all CSS-related signals at the browser engine level. Color scheme, feature availability, rendering behavior, and system colors all match the profile's declared platform regardless of the host OS.

## Common Scenarios

- Capture a baseline result using the Quick Start setup.
- Change one relevant setting at a time and compare the new output.
- Keep your final launch command documented so future checks are reproducible.

## Troubleshooting / FAQ

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| System font renders as host OS font | Verify `--bot-config-fonts=profile` is set. |
| Color scheme doesn't match expectation | Set explicitly with `--bot-config-color-scheme=light` or `dark`. |
| @supports query reveals wrong platform | Check that the profile matches your intended platform. Feature availability follows the profile. |
| CSS system colors expose host theme | Ensure profile is loaded. System colors are controlled at the engine level. |
