# DRM Fingerprint Consistency

> DRM capabilities expose platform identity. BotBrowser controls DRM-related responses to maintain consistent privacy protection.

## Overview

Digital Rights Management (DRM) capabilities vary by platform. The Encrypted Media Extensions (EME) API reports different supported configurations, robustness levels, and key systems depending on the operating system. BotBrowser ensures that DRM capability responses are consistent with the profile's platform identity.

## Configuration

DRM behavior is controlled through the profile. The profile defines which key systems are reported as available, supported robustness levels, session type capabilities, and codec support within DRM contexts. No separate CLI flag is needed for DRM fingerprint consistency.

For Widevine CDM setup, playback configuration, and platform-specific details, see the [Widevine DRM Setup Guide](../platform/WIDEVINE_DRM_SETUP.md).
